# raspberry-pi-32bit-rootfs-proot-distro-like
Just a minimal Trixie rootfs made from DietPi and stripped to be like a proot-distro rootfs. Since Trixie is stable now, one rootfs should last a long time.

And it's armv6l (hf), a novelty to try in a chroot if you have a normal ARM machine but want to compare it to old ARM.
